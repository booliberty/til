Today I Learned
_______________

The objective here is to document interesting things I learn in the context of
accomplishing various sorts of goals, mostly related to information systems
engineering and administration.  

I strive to do this daily, with no particular emphasis on a theme, standard, or
level of academic rigor.  In fact, there may be a measure of factual inaccuracy
here.  I prefer to provide context and meaning that makes this a valuable
mental exercise that leaves behind more than a code snippet library.  Sometimes,
though, aint nobody got time for that.
